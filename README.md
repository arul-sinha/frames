<h1>HTML Frames</h1>
To run: open index.html
This uses a page called links.html containing anchors targeted to the right frame of the index.html file. the links.html is in yet another frame which is in the left side of the index.html. This creates a dynamic navbar type layout in which the URL of the page does not change and you still get multiple web pages.
